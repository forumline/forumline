# Forumline Demo

## Testing

**Always test through production**: https://forum-chat-voice.vercel.app

Do NOT use local dev server for testing. Use Playwright to interact with the production site.

## Deployment

Both projects deploy via GitHub Actions on push to main. Do NOT deploy via Vercel CLI or Vercel dashboard.

- **Forumline Demo** (forum-chat-voice.vercel.app): `.github/workflows/deploy-forum.yml` — triggers on `demo/` or `packages/` changes
- **Forumline Central Services** (forumline-hub.vercel.app): `.github/workflows/deploy-hub.yml` — triggers only on `central-services/` changes

Both use the `VERCEL_TOKEN` GitHub secret.

## Testing
When testing, always be on the look out for bugs unrelated to changes. Jot them down and present them to the user at the conclusion of testing as potentional next steps to fix.
