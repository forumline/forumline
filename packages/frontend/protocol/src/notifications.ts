/*
 * Cross-Forum Notification Protocol
 *
 * Defines the notification types that forums emit and the Forumline app aggregates into a unified inbox.
 *
 * It must:
 * - Enumerate the notification categories (replies, mentions, chat mentions, DMs, custom) so the app can filter and display them appropriately
 * - Represent individual notifications with enough context (title, body, link, source forum) for the user to act on them without leaving the app
 * - Define unread count summaries so the app can show badge counts across all forums at a glance
 * - Provide a server-side notification input type for forums to create new notifications through the SDK
